# Step 05 — Images

## GLOBAL CONVENTIONS (copy this block first)
```
**GLOBAL CONVENTIONS — Paste at top of every run**

**SYSTEM / RULES**
- You are contributing to a monorepo with strict acceptance tests defined in `agents.md` at the repo root.
- Output **only** a set of *unified diffs* and new/modified file contents. For any new files, include the **complete file body**.
- Every code change **must** include tests (unit and/or e2e) that cover the new behavior.
- Keep changes **scoped to this step**. Do not modify unrelated areas.
- Maintain **schema validity**, **determinism**, **convergence**, **RBAC**, **security**, **accessibility**, and **i18n** invariants from `agents.md`.
- All edits (human or AI) must go through the **same operation pipeline**.
- Selections, decorations, and attribution **must map** correctly after each change.
- After code, append a “**SELF‑CHECK**” section listing which acceptance tests now pass and why.
- If a requirement cannot be completed, produce a minimal vertical slice + TODO tests; **do not hallucinate**.
- Prefer **TypeScript** (strict) for app/back‑end, **Next.js/React** for web, **ProseMirror/TipTap** for editor, **Yjs** for CRDT, **Postgres** for persistence, **Playwright** for e2e, **Vitest/Jest** for unit, **zod** for types.

## STEP PROMPT (copy this block after the preamble)

```
TASK
Implement image paste/drag-and-drop:
- Placeholder node with progress state.
- Mock uploader service (deterministic in tests).
- Retry UI on failure.
- Resize handles (keyboard accessible) and alt text editing.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do not block typing during uploads.
- Store attrs: {src, alt, width}. Maintain aspect ratio.

DELIVERABLES
- Image node view + uploader adapter.
- Tests:
  - B.5 `image-clipboard`, `image-dnd`, `image-resize`, `image-retry`

ACCEPTANCE
- Placeholders display immediately; retries work; resizing and alt editing pass e2e.
```
